  <section id="about">
    <p>Revers3D is a modern take on the classic board game, Reversi. With the board wrapped into a 3D environment, the strategy and gameplay has been taken into a whole new dimension (oh ho!).</p>

    <p>For those who are unfamiliar with the gameplay, the goal is to have the most tiles by the end of the game. This is accomplished by surrounding your opponents tiles on either side of their chain from any angle. All angles are fair game, so keep an eye out for horizontal, vertical, positive, and negative opportunities!</p>

    <p>Those of you who have played Reversi (or Othello) will learn that your old strategies won't work here. Edes and corners aren't what they used to be, so you'll need to find a new way to play the game. Challenge your mind, and your friends, and get <span class="accent">Revers3D!</span></p>
